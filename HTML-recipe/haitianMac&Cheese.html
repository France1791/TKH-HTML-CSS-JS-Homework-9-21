            <h3>How to make haitian Mac&Cheese</h3>
            <h4>ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Pasta</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>
                <li>Onions</li>
                <li>Peppers</li>
                <li>Evaporated Milk</li>
                <li>Mayonnaise</li>
                <li>Cheese</li>
                <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
            </ul>
                <h4>Steps</h4>
                <li><strong>Sautee the veggies</strong> Do this first and then set them aside for later use!</li>
                <li><strong>Cook the pasta</strong> When it comes to pasta bakes, Haitians like to cook the pasta until soft while Italians like to cook it until al dente. Generally, Haitians want their pasta extra soft and that’s why they fully cook it before popping it in the oven. If you like your pasta with a bit more structure, definitely cook it until al dente.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Combine the ingredients</strong> This is what makes this recipe so effortlessly easy: just mix together the milk, mayo, cheese, pasta, and veggies and that’s a wrap! No need to prepare a sauce or anything fancy.</li>
                <li><strong>Bake</strong> until golden on top and serve. I personally like to top this dish off with fresh oregano leaves and freshly cracked pepper!</li>
